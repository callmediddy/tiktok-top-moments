    "description": "FNMeka was one of the earliest virtual influencer avatars and is currently the biggest male virtual influencer avatar on TikTok with 10M followers. Virtual avatars will become an important part of the metaverse because they provide an outlet for real people to reflect their personalities, interests, and aspirations in fantastical ways that would be impossible in the real world. FNMekaâ€™s unique sense of humor and personality are very real, but his infinite wealth and lavish lifestyle exist in the digital world, which many describe as the metaverse.\n\nIn the metaverse, FNMeka can be whatever he wants, whenever he wants â€“ and in this case he wants to be a chef and test out his cooking skills. FNMekaâ€™s personality is both uniquely his own, and a reflection of that of his creatorâ€™s. FNMeka hopes to show others that they, too, can be whoever they want to be through their own Virtual Avatars.",
