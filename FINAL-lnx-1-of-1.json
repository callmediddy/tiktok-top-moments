    "description": "This TikTok was created by printing 81 frames of Lil Nas X performing Montero, cutting out his clothes, then photographing the cutouts around Seattle.\n\nEach background reflects something about the genius that is Lil Nas X. For instance:\n- A Pride flag to symbolize his LGBTQ activism\n- Street art because of his hip-hop roots\n- A sunset to reflect his sunny, optimistic personality\n- Flowers to show his beauty\n- Fire to give a nod to the music video\n- Neon because of his futuristic, forward thinking art.\n\nEverything was shot practically with no green screens, giving a human touch to digital art. The quick cuts are meant to create a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of color, almost hypnotizing your brain and forcing your eyes to focus on the subject moving on the page.\n\nThe goal of my art is to add a pop of positivity to people’s day. Sometimes the world can be stressful, and I’ve found creativity is the best antidote.",
